# Kunitz_project_LB1
this is my project of LB1 about Building a Profile Hidden Markov Model for the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain for UNIBO master's degree in Bioinformatics.

in HMM_Beatrice_Pastorino_raw_version.docx you can find a raw version of the main report with more references to the steps followed into materials_methods_steps.ipynb file but without final refinement (no literature references),
in "supplementary_material" folder you can find material_methods_steps.ipynb that contains all the detailed steps of the workflow with the related codes and commands and "files" that contains all the files used during the steps (except for negative1.fasta that you can find on my google drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jHVFDIQXiyMxm4s4Dxyey9Fid8FEBfkI?usp=sharing), their names can be traced in the material_methods_steps.ipynb file
the final version of the main report is project-lb1b-Beatrice_Pastorino.pdf
