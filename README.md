# Kunitz_project_LB1
this is my project of LB1 about Building a Profile Hidden Markov Model for the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain for UNIBO master's degree in Bioinformatics.
material_methods_steps.ipynb contains all the detailed steps of the workflow with the related codes and commands,
in HMM_Beatrice_Pastorino_raw_version.docx you can find a raw version of the main report with more references to the steps followed into materials_methods_steps.ipynb file but without final refinement (no literature references),
in "supplementary_material_LB1" folder you can find all the files used during the steps (except for negative1.fasta that you can find on my google drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jHVFDIQXiyMxm4s4Dxyey9Fid8FEBfkI?usp=sharing), their names can be traced in the material_methods_steps.ipynb file
project-lb1b-Beatrice_Pastorino.pdf is the final version of the main report.
